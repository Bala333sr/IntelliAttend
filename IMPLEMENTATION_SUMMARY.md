# IntelliAttend - Dual-Approval Device Enforcement Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete implementation of the **PhonePe-style single active device enforcement** system with **dual-approval mechanism** (48-hour cooldown + admin approval) for the IntelliAttend attendance system.

---

## System Architecture

### Two-Phase Registration Process

1. **Phase 1: CSV Bulk Import (Admin)**
   - Admin imports student account information via CSV
   - Creates user accounts and student records
   - No device binding at this stage

2. **Phase 2: Device Binding (Mobile App)**
   - Students install mobile app
   - First login on campus WiFi registers and activates their device
   - Device becomes the ONLY active device for that student

### Device Security Policy

**Key Principle:** Only ONE device can be active per student at any time.

#### Dual-Approval Mechanism for Device Switches

When a student needs to change devices, they must satisfy **BOTH** conditions:

1. **48-Hour Cooldown Period** ⏱️
   - Automatic timer starts when student logs in with new device
   - Student can VIEW data but CANNOT mark attendance
   - Prevents impulsive device sharing

2. **Admin Manual Approval** ✅
   - Even after 48 hours, admin must explicitly approve
   - Admin can approve before or after cooldown completes
   - Device activates only when BOTH conditions are met

**Benefits:**
- Prevents unauthorized device sharing
- Gives institution control over device changes
- Deters account abuse and proxy attendance
- Provides audit trail for security

---

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables

#### 1. `device_switch_requests`
Tracks all device change requests with approval workflow.

```sql
CREATE TABLE device_switch_requests (
    request_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES students(student_id),
    old_device_uuid VARCHAR(255),
    old_device_name VARCHAR(255),
    new_device_uuid VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    new_device_name VARCHAR(255),
    new_device_type VARCHAR(50),
    new_device_model VARCHAR(255),
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',  -- pending, approved, rejected
    reason TEXT,
    requested_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    approved_at TIMESTAMP,
    rejected_at TIMESTAMP,
    rejected_reason TEXT,
    approved_by_admin_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id),
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,
    additional_info JSONB
);
```

#### 2. `device_activity_logs`
Comprehensive audit trail of all device-related activities.

```sql
CREATE TABLE device_activity_logs (
    log_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES students(student_id),
    device_uuid VARCHAR(255),
    activity_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    activity_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    additional_info JSONB
);
```

### Modified Tables

#### `student_devices`
Added activation tracking fields:

```sql
ALTER TABLE student_devices
ADD COLUMN activated_at TIMESTAMP,
ADD COLUMN deactivated_at TIMESTAMP,
ADD COLUMN last_seen TIMESTAMP;
```

2. System validates campus WiFi
3. Creates user account and student record
4. Registers device as active immediately
5. Returns full access token

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful! Device registered and activated.",
  "device_status": "active",
  "can_mark_attendance": true
}
```

### State 2: Same Device Login

}
```

### State 3: New Device - Cooldown Active
**Scenario:** Student logs in with new device (within 48 hours)

**Flow:**
1. System detects device switch
2. Creates device_switch_request with status='pending'
3. Deactivates old device
4. Registers new device as inactive
5. Returns limited access token

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "New device detected. Limited access granted.",
  "device_status": "pending_cooldown",
  "limited_access": true,
  "can_mark_attendance": false,
  "cooldown_info": {
    "hours_elapsed": 0.5,
    "hours_remaining": 47.5,
    "activation_date": "2024-01-17T14:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### State 4: Cooldown Complete, Admin Approval Pending
**Scenario:** 48 hours passed, but admin hasn't approved yet

**Flow:**
1. System checks cooldown status
2. Checks approval status
3. Returns limited access with different message

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful (Awaiting Admin Approval)",
  "device_status": "awaiting_admin_approval",
  "limited_access": true,
  "can_mark_attendance": false,
  "approval_info": {
    "cooldown_completed": true,
    "admin_approval_pending": true,
    "message": "The 48-hour cooldown is complete. Your device activation request is now pending admin approval.",
    "restrictions": {

      "can_view_classes": true,
      "can_view_profile": true,
      "can_mark_attendance": false,
      "reason": "Dual approval required: 48-hour cooldown complete ✓ | Admin approval pending ⏳"
    }
  }
}
```

### State 5: Fully Activated
**Scenario:** Both cooldown complete AND admin approved

**Flow:**
1. System checks both conditions
2. Activates device
3. Deactivates all other devices
4. Marks request as completed
5. Returns full access

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Device fully activated! You can now mark attendance.",

    "cooldown_completed": true,
    "admin_approved": true,
    "cooldown_hours": 50.2
  }
}
```

---

## Admin Workflows

### 1. Review Pending Device Switch Requests

```bash
GET /api/admin/devices/switch-requests?status=pending&cooldown_complete=true
```

**Admin sees:**
- Student information
- Old and new device details
- Reason for switch (if provided)
- Cooldown status
- Time elapsed and remaining
- Whether request is ready for approval

### 2. Approve Device Switch

```bash
POST /api/admin/devices/switch-requests/{id}/approve
Body: {
  "notes": "Verified with student. Approved."
}
```

**System actions:**
- If cooldown complete: Immediately activates new device
- If cooldown incomplete: Marks as approved, activation happens when student next logs in after cooldown
- Deactivates all other devices
- Logs approval action

### 3. Reject Device Switch

```bash
POST /api/admin/devices/switch-requests/{id}/reject
Body: {
  "reason": "Suspicious pattern detected. Multiple device changes."
}
```

**System actions:**
- Marks request as rejected
- Keeps old device active
- New device remains inactive
- Logs rejection with reason

### 4. Emergency Device Activation

```bash
POST /api/admin/devices/students/{code}/devices/{uuid}/emergency-activate
Body: {
  "reason": "Phone stolen. Police report filed.",
  "admin_notes": "Verified with student ID."
}
```

**System actions:**
- Immediately activates new device (bypasses cooldown)
- Auto-approves any pending request
- Deactivates all other devices
- Logs emergency activation

  -d '{"notes": "Approved"}'
```

---

## Mobile App Integration

### Required Changes (Frontend)

The last remaining task is updating the mobile app UI to display device status banners:

#### 1. Device Status Banner Component

```javascript
// Display banner based on device status
if (deviceStatus === 'pending_cooldown') {
  return <Banner type="warning">
    Device pending activation - You can view data but cannot mark attendance until {activationDate}
    <CountdownTimer targetDate={activationDate} />
  </Banner>
}

if (deviceStatus === 'awaiting_admin_approval') {
  return <Banner type="info">
    Cooldown complete! Your device activation is pending admin approval. 
    You can view data but cannot mark attendance yet.
  </Banner>
}

if (deviceStatus === 'active') {
  return null; // No banner, full access
}
```

#### 2. Attendance Button State

```javascript
const canMarkAttendance = deviceStatus === 'active';

<AttendanceButton 
  disabled={!canMarkAttendance}
  onPress={markAttendance}
/>

{!canMarkAttendance && (
  <Text style={styles.disabledReason}>
    {getRestrictionReason(deviceStatus)}
  </Text>
)}
```

#### 3. Countdown Timer

```javascript
const CountdownTimer = ({ targetDate }) => {
  const [timeRemaining, setTimeRemaining] = useState('');
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      const hours = calculateHoursRemaining(targetDate);
      setTimeRemaining(`${hours.toFixed(1)} hours remaining`);
    }, 60000); // Update every minute
    
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, [targetDate]);
  
  return <Text>{timeRemaining}</Text>;
};
```

---

## Activity Types Logged

The system logs the following device activities:

- `device_registered` - New device added to student account
- `device_activated` - Device becomes active
- `device_deactivated` - Device deactivated (auto or manual)
- `switch_request_created` - Device switch request initiated
- `switch_request_approved` - Admin approved switch request
- `switch_request_rejected` - Admin rejected switch request
- `emergency_activation` - Emergency device activation
- `login_attempt` - Student login attempt
- `attendance_blocked` - Attendance attempt from inactive device

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes

```sql
-- Created for optimal query performance
CREATE INDEX idx_device_switch_student_status ON device_switch_requests(student_id, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_device_switch_requested_at ON device_switch_requests(requested_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_activity_logs_student ON device_activity_logs(student_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_activity_logs_timestamp ON device_activity_logs(activity_timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_student_devices_active ON student_devices(student_id, is_active);
```

### Caching Recommendations

- Cache campus WiFi configurations
- Cache device activation status for frequent checks
- Use Redis for cooldown timer tracking (optional optimization)
