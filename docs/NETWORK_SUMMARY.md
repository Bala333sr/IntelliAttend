# IntelliAttend Network Summary

## What is the Network Connection?

The IntelliAttend system uses a client-server architecture where the Android mobile app (client) communicates with a Flask server (server) over the internet using secure HTTPS connections.

## How Does the Connection Work?

### 1. Initial Setup
1. **Server**: Runs on a computer/server accessible via the internet
2. **Mobile App**: Installed on student/faculty Android devices
3. **Database**: MySQL database that stores all system data
4. **QR System**: Special system that generates changing QR codes

### 2. Connection Process
1. **App Startup**: Mobile app opens and connects to the server
2. **Login**: User enters credentials (email/password)
3. **Authentication**: Server verifies credentials and gives app a "token"
4. **Secure Communication**: All future communication uses this token

### 3. HTTPS Connection Details
- **Protocol**: HTTPS (like secure websites)
- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted (like online banking)
- **Port**: Usually port 5002 for development, 443 for production
- **Security**: Uses modern encryption (TLS 1.2+)

## What Data Flows Between App and Server?

### From App to Server:
1. **Login Information**: Email and password
2. **Attendance Data**: 
   - Scanned QR codes
   - Biometric verification (fingerprint/face)
   - GPS location
   - WiFi network information
   - Bluetooth device detection
   - Device information
3. **Requests**: 
   - View attendance history
   - Check active sessions
   - Register device

### From Server to App:
1. **Authentication Token**: For secure communication
2. **Student Profile**: Name, ID, program information
3. **Session Information**: Active class sessions
4. **Attendance Records**: History of attendance
5. **QR Codes**: Current dynamic QR codes for attendance

## Step-by-Step Network Flow

### Authentication Flow:
```
1. Student opens app
2. Enters email/password
3. App sends to server: "Here's my login info"
4. Server checks database: "Is this correct?"
5. Server responds: "Yes, here's your access token"
6. App stores token for future use
```

### Attendance Session Flow:
```
1. Faculty logs in to SmartBoard
2. Generates OTP (one-time password)
3. SmartBoard tells server: "Start attendance session"
4. Server creates session and starts QR generation
5. QR codes change every 5 seconds for 2 minutes
6. Students scan current QR with mobile app
```

### Attendance Marking Flow:
```
1. Student scans QR code
2. App collects verification data:
   - Biometric scan
   - GPS location
   - WiFi information
   - Bluetooth devices
3. App sends all data to server
4. Server validates everything:
   - Is QR code valid?
   - Is student in right location?
   - Is biometric verified?
   - Are required devices nearby?
5. Server creates attendance record
6. Server responds with success/failure
```

## Security Measures

### Data Protection:
1. **Encryption**: All data encrypted during transfer
2. **Authentication**: Tokens ensure only authorized users access data
3. **Validation**: Server checks all data before accepting
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of the system

### QR Code Security:
1. **Dynamic**: QR codes change every 5 seconds
2. **Time-limited**: Only valid for short periods
3. **Single-use**: Can't be shared between students
4. **Signed**: Cryptographically secured

## Connection Protocols

### HTTP/HTTPS:
- **Method**: REST API (standard web communication)
- **Format**: JSON (structured data format)
- **Security**: HTTPS with TLS encryption
- **Compression**: Data compressed for faster transfer

### Error Handling:
- **Timeouts**: Automatic retry for failed connections
- **Offline Mode**: Store data locally when offline
- **Error Messages**: Clear feedback for connection issues
- **Logging**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting

## Performance Considerations

### Speed:
- **Response Time**: Usually under 1 second
- **QR Generation**: New QR every 5 seconds
- **Data Transfer**: Optimized for mobile networks

### Reliability:
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections for efficiency
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for temporary failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue working when possible

## Network Requirements

### For Mobile App:
- **Internet**: WiFi or mobile data connection
- **Bandwidth**: Minimal (QR codes are small images)
- **Latency**: Works well on 3G/4G/5G/WiFi
- **Security**: Modern Android with security updates

### For Server:
- **Bandwidth**: Sufficient for all connected devices
- **Processing**: Handle multiple simultaneous connections
- **Storage**: Database storage for attendance records
- **Security**: Firewall and security measures

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Connection Problems:
1. **Check Internet**: Ensure device has internet access
2. **Server Status**: Verify server is running
3. **Firewall**: Ensure ports are not blocked
4. **Certificates**: Check SSL certificate validity

### Authentication Issues:
1. **Credentials**: Verify email/password
2. **Tokens**: Check if token has expired
3. **Account Status**: Ensure account is active

### Data Sync Issues:
1. **Network**: Check connection stability
2. **Storage**: Ensure sufficient device storage
3. **Permissions**: Verify app has necessary permissions

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements:
1. **WebSocket**: Real-time notifications
2. **Offline Sync**: Better offline capabilities
3. **Load Balancing**: Multiple servers for high availability
4. **CDN**: Faster content delivery
