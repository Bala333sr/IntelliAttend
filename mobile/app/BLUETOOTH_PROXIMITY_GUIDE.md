# 🎯 Bluetooth Proximity Detection & Attendance Marking

## ✅ **ENHANCED PROXIMITY DETECTION SYSTEM**

Your app now provides **clear, actionable proximity information** for registered Bluetooth devices:

### **📊 PROXIMITY STATUS INDICATORS**

| RSSI Range | Status | Color | Attendance |
|------------|--------|--------|------------|
| **>= -50 dBm** | `VERY NEAR (Excellent)` | 🟢 Dark Green | ✅ **Can Mark** |
| **>= -65 dBm** | `IN RANGE (Good)` | 🟢 Light Green | ✅ **Can Mark** |
| **>= -80 dBm** | `IN RANGE (Fair)` | 🟡 Amber | ✅ **Can Mark** |
| **< -80 dBm** | `OUT OF RANGE (Too Far)` | 🔴 Red | ❌ **Too Far** |
| **0 dBm** | `OUT OF RANGE` | ⚫ Gray | ❌ **Not Detected** |

### **🎯 ATTENDANCE MARKING CRITERIA**
- **Device must be registered** (added via Bluetooth Scanner)
- **RSSI >= -80 dBm** (within reasonable range)
- **Active detection** (RSSI != 0)

## 📱 **USER INTERFACE FEATURES**

### **1. Attendance Status Summary Card**
- Shows **X of Y devices IN RANGE for attendance**
- ✅ Green when devices are in range
- ⚠️ Red when no devices in range
- Clear guidance: "Ready to mark attendance!" or "Move closer to registered devices"

### **2. Enhanced Device Cards**
Each registered device now shows:
- **Device name and MAC address**
- **Proximity status badge** with icon
- **RSSI value** in color-coded format
- **"MARK ATTENDANCE" button** (only when in range)

### **3. Visual Indicators**
- **✓ Green checkmark**: Device in range for attendance
- **✗ Red X**: Device out of range
- **Card highlighting**: In-range devices have highlighted background

## 🔄 **HOW IT WORKS**

### **Step 1: Register Bluetooth Devices**
1. Go to **Bluetooth Scanner** from Home
2. Scan for devices near the classroom
3. Click **"+" button** to register classroom beacons/devices

### **Step 2: Monitor Proximity in Environmental Data**
1. Go to **"Test Environmental Data Collection"** from Home
2. **GPS & Wi-Fi data loads automatically** (updates every 15 seconds)
3. **Bluetooth scanning is USER-TRIGGERED ONLY** - no automatic scanning
4. Click **Bluetooth refresh button** for fresh 12-second scan
5. Check **Attendance Status Summary** after scanning

### **Step 3: Mark Attendance**
1. When devices show **"IN RANGE"** status after scanning
2. Click **"✓ MARK ATTENDANCE"** button
3. System confirms device proximity for attendance

## 🎯 **PRACTICAL USAGE SCENARIOS**

### **Classroom Entry Scenario:**
```
📱 Student opens app → Environmental Data Collection
📍 Status: "0 of 2 devices IN RANGE for attendance"
🚶‍♂️ Student moves closer to classroom beacon
🔄 Refresh scan shows: "ClassroomBeacon_A: VERY NEAR (-45 dBm)"
✅ Status: "1 of 2 devices IN RANGE for attendance"
👆 Student clicks "MARK ATTENDANCE" button
🎯 Attendance marked successfully!
```

### **Range Testing:**
- **Very Near (-45 dBm)**: Next to device, excellent signal
- **Good Range (-60 dBm)**: Within classroom, good for attendance  
- **Fair Range (-75 dBm)**: Edge of classroom, still acceptable
- **Too Far (-90 dBm)**: Outside classroom, attendance blocked

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### **User-Triggered Scanning (Battery Efficient):**
- **NO automatic Bluetooth scanning** - saves battery
- GPS & Wi-Fi update automatically every 15 seconds
- Bluetooth scans **only when user taps refresh button**
- Each scan performs **complete 12-second fresh scan**
- Clears all cached results before scanning
- Uses same timing as initial scan (700ms BLE + 12s Classic)
- Updates only after scan completion

### **Proximity Calculation:**
```kotlin
val canMarkAttendance = device.rssi != 0 && device.rssi >= -80

val proximityStatus = when {
    device.rssi == 0 -> "OUT OF RANGE"
    device.rssi >= -50 -> "VERY NEAR (Excellent)"  
    device.rssi >= -65 -> "IN RANGE (Good)"
    device.rssi >= -80 -> "IN RANGE (Fair)"
    else -> "OUT OF RANGE (Too Far)"
}
```
